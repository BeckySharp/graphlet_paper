\section{Approach}
\label{sec:approach}

%As we are framing the task of question answering (QA) as answer entailment, we begin by transforming a given question and candidate answer as an  

Our question answering (QA) approach operates in three steps, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:approach}.  First we use the terms from the question and answer candidate to query the knowledge base (KB).  This produces a set of background knowledge sentences that we will align with the question and answer candidate to determine how well the KB supports the given answer candidate.   Next we generate a representation of the question with its answer candidate as well as each of the KB sentences.
